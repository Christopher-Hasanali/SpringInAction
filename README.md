# SpringInAction

Just messing around Ant build tool with Ivy dependency management tool to explore more about its potential.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
1) Install ant
2) Install ivy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running


```
ant release  #For running application, Check other targets in build.xml file
ant springrelease && ant springrun #for running spring application via Apache Ant + Ivy
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
